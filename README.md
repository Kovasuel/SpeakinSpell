# SpeakinSpell
BfA / 8.0 update for SpeakinSpell

To install:

1) Click the green 'Clone or download' button
2) Download the .zip
3) Extract the .zip to a folder
4) Within the SpeakinSpell folder you just extracted, there is another SpeakinSpell folder, along with a README.md file. Copy that SpeakinSpell folder.
5) Go to your World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns and move the existing SpeakinSpell folder somewhere else to keep as a backup copy.
6) Copy in your new SpeakinSpell folder
7) Launch the game

NOTE: Be sure to keep all other SpeakinSpell-related folders (SpeakinSpell_Defaults, SpeakinSpell_GUI, and SpeakinSpell_Patches) in your AddOns folder. ONLY remove the SpeakinSpell folder and replace it with this one.
